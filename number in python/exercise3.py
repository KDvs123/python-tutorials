#You want to replace tiles in your bathroom 
# which is exactly square and 5.5 feet is its length. 
# If tiles cost 500 rs per square feet, 
# how much will be the total cost to replace all tiles. 
# Calculate and print the cost using python 
# (Hint: Use power operator ** to find area of a square)


area_of_the_bathroom=5.5**2
tile_cost_per_sqfeet=500

print("Total cost to replace all tiles: ",area_of_the_bathroom*tile_cost_per_sqfeet)
