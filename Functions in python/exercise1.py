# Write a function called calculate_area that takes base and height as an input and returns and area of a triangle. Equation of an area of a triangle is,
# area = (1/2)*base*height

def calculate_area(base,height):
    area= (1/2) * base *height
    
    return area


area_of_a_traingle=calculate_area(5,6)
print("The area of the triangle is", area_of_a_traingle)
